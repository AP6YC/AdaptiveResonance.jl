# [Examples](@id examples)

This section describes how you can set up your demos easily in _five lines of codes_.

## Manage your demo files

The rules of demo management are super simple:

* you need one demo page (folder) to hold all the demo files
* a demo page has several demo sections (subfolders)
* a demo section either
    * has other demo sections as nested subsections, or,
    * has the demo files (`.md`, `.jl`)
